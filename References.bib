  abstract = {The aim of the annual publication of Cancer in Norway (CiN) is to provide detailed cancer statistics. This pub lication should help health professionals, policy-makers and researchers to identify and make decisions about areas that need more attention and investigation. This publication may also be valuable for the media, educat ors and members of the public with an interest in cancer. Due to random variation in incidence rates from one year to another, cancer trends should be interpreted by examining the rates over several years. Furthermore, the number of cancer cases for 2022 might be slightly un derreported due to delayed notification of cancer cases. The data for this report were extracted on 16 April 2023. The report is available online at: https://www.kreftregisteret.no/ Incidence data are available online at: https://www.kreftregisteret.no/ Registrene/data-og-statistikk/ statistikkbank/},

	isbn = {978-0-471-65574-9},
	abstract = {Demonstrates how nonresponse in sample surveys and censuses can be handled by replacing each missing value with two or more multiple imputations. Clearly illustrates the advantages of modern computing to such handle surveys, and demonstrates the benefit of this statistical technique for researchers who must analyze them. Also presents the background for Bayesian and frequentist theory. After establishing that only standard complete-data methods are needed to analyze a multiply-imputed set, the text evaluates procedures in general circumstances, outlining specific procedures for creating imputations in both the ignorable and nonignorable cases. Examples and exercises reinforce ideas, and the interplay of Bayesian and frequentist ideas presents a unified picture of modern statistics.},
